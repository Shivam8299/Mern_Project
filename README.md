## About

This project is a basic example of a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. It is designed for learning and demonstration purposes, showing how to connect a backend (Node.js/Express) with a frontend (React) and a database (MongoDB).

---

## Features

- User-friendly interface with React
- RESTful API with Express and Node.js
- MongoDB database for storing data
- Easy to understand and extend

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Others:** JavaScript, CSS

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivam8299/Mern_Project.git
cd Mern_Project
```

### 2. Install dependencies for server and client

```bash
# Install server dependencies
npm install

# Go to client directory and install dependencies
cd client
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your MongoDB connection string:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

### 4. Run the application

#### Option 1: Run backend and frontend separately

```bash
# In the root folder, start the backend
npm run server

# In another terminal, go to the client folder and start React
cd client
npm start
```

#### Option 2: Run both with one command (if configured)

```bash
npm run dev
```
